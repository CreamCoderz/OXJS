OnSIP XMPP JavaScript
---------------------

The OnSIP XMPP Javascript library (oxjs) is a fully functional
implementation of the OnSIP XMPP-API.  The my.onsip.com interface
utilizes oxjs on top of strophe for it's XMPP & XMPP-API connectivity.

Getting Started:

make src
make doc

Overview:

This library is NOT a client side BOSH implementation.  It, wraps a BOSH connection to facilitate the process of subscribing to the OnSIPP XMPP pubsub services and making the OnSIP specific adhoc command calls.

Tests:

You're probably just best off reading the tests to get an idea of how to use this library. You can open test/index.html in any browser to run the unit tests.

Ignore 'make test', it's incomplete as is

Examples:

For the examples to work properly they must be served from same domain as the bosh resource they are trying to connect to in order to avoid cross domain issues.
